### Fighter List Module

- Users can click on a fighter's name from the module to render their bio and fight stats. 

### Career Stats
- A fighter's career stats will appear at the bottom of the page simultaneously with the rendering of the aforemention fighter bio/snapshot.
- Career Stat charts consist of four distinct charts (career: (1)bouts, (2)rounds, (3)K.O.%, (4)win%), each of which can be viewed by clicking on the respective chart type in a dropdown menu.
- the currently selected fighter's career bar is highlighted orange to distinguish it from the other top fighters.
